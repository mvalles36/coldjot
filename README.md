## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Required Versions:**

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0 (or yarn)

Before running the application, you'll need to set up several services and environment variables:

1. **Setup Local Services with Docker**

   - Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
   - Run the following commands in order to populate your dependencies and setup docker:

     ```bash
     npm install
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

   - If you encounter any issues, try cleaning up:

     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     rm -rf node_modules
     rm package-lock.json
     ```

2. **Google OAuth Setup**

- We have to setup 2 different clients in a google console project
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
- Create a new project
- Add the following APIs in your Google Cloud Project:
  - [Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)
  - Enable the Google OAuth2 API
- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application type)
- Add authorized redirect URIs:
  - Development:
    - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
    - `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mail/auth/google/callback`
  - Production:
    - `https://your-production-url/api/auth/callback/google`
    - `https://your-production-url/api/v1/mail/auth/google/callback`

> [!WARNING] The redirect URIs must match **exactly** what you configure in the Google Cloud Console, including the protocol (http/https), domain, and path.

### Environment Variables

1. Copy the example env files:

```bash
# Copy example env files for all applications
cp apps/web/env/.env.example apps/web/env/.env.development
cp apps/mailops/env/.env.example apps/mailops/env/.env.development
